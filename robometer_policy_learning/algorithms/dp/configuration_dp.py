    """
    Configuration for the Diffusion Policy (DP) algorithm.

    Diffusion Policy (Chi et al., 2023) frames behavior cloning as conditional denoising:
    a network learns to predict the noise that was added to an (action chunk) given the
    current observation as conditioning. At inference time, actions are produced by running
    the learned reverse diffusion process starting from Gaussian noise.

    The policy operates entirely in the actor's normalized ([-1, 1]) action space. The
    replay buffer is responsible for mapping stored env-space actions into [-1, 1] (via
    ``min_action`` / ``max_action``); ``act()`` unnormalizes back to the env action space.
